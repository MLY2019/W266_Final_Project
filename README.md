## Automatic Classification of English Tweets Reporting Adverse Effects of Medication by Deep Learning

### UC Berkeley MIDS W266 Final Project
With the rapid growth of social networking users worldwide, social media has become an important source of health related information. Advances in automatic data processing and NLP provide opportunities for health and medical data mining from this massive data source. Here is presented the effort to automatically classify English tweets reporting adverse effects of medication, which is a subtask of the SMM4H’20 shared task. Previous work has shown outperformance of BERT on this task, compared to traditional machine learning systems or other deep neural architectures. We applied BERTweet, a recently released large scale pre-trained language model for English tweets on this task and obtained significantly better results than the baseline from the BERT model. Medications mentioning reddit posts were obtained and labeled as additional dataset for model training but no further improvement of model performance was observed. Future work could be sprawling medication mentioning tweets to pre-train the BERTweet model.
